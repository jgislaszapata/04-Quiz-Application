# 04-Quiz-Application

This project was an attempt to make an application that creates a timed coding quiz.
This application runs in the browswer and present the user with a timed quiz and their scores.

This application begins with a landing page which explains the quiz and features a 'start quiz' button which then begins the 5 question quiz on a one minute timer. For each incorrect question, the user is docked 5 seconds from the timer. At the end of the five questions, a heading appears letting the user know that the game is over.
